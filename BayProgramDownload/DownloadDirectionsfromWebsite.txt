Chesapeake Bay Program MDNR Dataset
The lab has previously looked at Chesapeake Bay data from 2010 and earlier – Sujay has the full dataset,
linked here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YfNdirSAxp8N_5CwYcRVOuhxde0AIzm-/view
We are gathering the data from 2010 to present so as to do analyses – confirm with Sujay if we’d like to
do analyses for the full dataset or just 2010-present. If we plan to use the full dataset, we may have to
expand steps listed below to the full dataset, since there may not be a clean file that can easily be used for
plotting, etc.
Description of datasets: http://datahub.chesapeakebay.net/
Water quality data: http://datahub.chesapeakebay.net/WaterQuality
To download the data:
-click the “water quality data” link above
-under “Source,” select “CBP Water Quality Data (1984-Present)”
-under “Data Type,” select “Water Quality Data”
-select “1/1/2010” as the start date and today’s date as the end date
-under “Data Stream,” select “Traditional Partner Data.” It will take a few minutes to load.
-under “Program,” select “All Programs”
-under “Geographical Attribute,” select “Monitoring Station.” It will take a few minutes to load.
-under “Attribute Selection,” select a monitoring station.
We will want to do analyses for all monitoring stations, but for organization’s sake, it may be
easier to get data from one site at a time, as all data for all monitoring stations will appear on the
same sheet of an excel file (it will be easier to work with if each site is in its own sheet, and thus,
it may be easier to download one site at a time).
-under “Parameter,” select ALL water quality parameters
-under “Format,” select CSV
-you will now have downloaded a csv file that you can open in Excel.
